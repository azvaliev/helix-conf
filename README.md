## TypeScript w/ ESLint 

Need to install:
- [VSCode language servers extracted](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted)
- [VTSLS](https://github.com/yioneko/vtsls)

### Cannot find tsconfig error

For me, my ESLint was having a rough time finding the `tsconfig.json`, and would often start looking in my src folder
It turns out there is one simple line which can help eslint know where to look for your `tsconfig.json`

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json",
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  }
}
```

The `tsconfigRootDir` option will tell ESLint to look for `tsconfig.json` relative to your `.eslintrc.js`.
